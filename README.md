# SimCIM QUBO Solver

This repository contains an implementation of the **SimCIM (Simulated Coherent Ising Machine)** algorithm for solving **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** problems. The SimCIM approach is a physics-inspired method leveraging continuous-variable systems for efficient optimization. The SimCIM code is based on an algorithm by Tiunove et al. (https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.010288), and is adopted with amendments from https://github.com/Human-machine/SimCIM4TSP/tree/main.

## Project Structure

- **SimCIM.py**: Implements the SimCIM algorithm, including amplitude updates, system dynamics, and iterative convergence.
- **functions.py**: Utility functions for handling QUBO matrix operations, energy computations, and parameter conversion.
- **main.py**: The main script that orchestrates the execution of the SimCIM solver on given QUBO instances.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries: NumPy, Torch, Matplotlib

You can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2. Add your data to the appropriate directory. QUBO problems used for this code can be found in https://github.com/rliang/qubo-benchmark-instances
3. Run the main script to solve a QUBO instance:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. Modify parameters in `SimCIM.py` to adjust optimization settings.
